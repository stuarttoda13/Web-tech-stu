                known a gorilla to read and study carefully seventeen books on bringing up baby gorillas. And they seem to
                know just what to do. They never worry about spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about
                not having enough time with them. Now, don't get me wrong, I'd rather be human than a gorilla any day. Just
                imagine having to sit in a zoo. (Did you figure out yet that while gorillas were on my mind, I could only
                find a picture of an elephant?)</td>

                think baby elephants wake up in the middle of the night and cry? Do their moms and dads take turns getting
                up with them to rock them back to sleep? How do you rock an elephant, anyway? And what about gorillas? </td>

            <td class="cri">Today in the paper there's a story about a new gorilla that was just born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding
                on to it just like any proud human mom. And I have to wonder if they go through as much trauma as that human
                mom when it comes to sleep, and food, and diapers, and running into the street. </td>

   <p class="scroll"> An elephant family is ruled by a matriarch (older female), and generally consist of her female 
offspring and their young. In Africa, a basic family unit consists of six to twelve animals, but 
families of twelve to twenty elephants are quite common. An elephant family will split depending
on the size of the family, the amount of available food, and how well they are getting along. 
When the matriarch dies, one of the oldest offspring takes her place. An elephant family is led 
by a matriarch, with the matriarch being the oldest and most experienced of the herd. The matriarchal 
society consists of her female offspring and their young. In some cases it may include one of the 
matriarch's sisters and her offspring as well. It is this close contact and relationship allows 
the rest of the elephant to acquire knowledge to be used when needed.
